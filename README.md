# How Many Planets Can You Fit Between Earth and Moon?

Inspiration for this page came when I was watching [Scott Manley’s](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg) live stream of Kerbal Space Program. Someone asked — can you fit all the planets of Solar System in space between the Earth and Moon? I thought it was a really good question to answer.

You can read the full story and assumptions I made on [Medium](https://medium.com/@conradthegray/how-many-planets-can-you-fit-between-earth-and-moon-7ee0a6d478ac). 

The project might contain some stupid solutions, as it was my first ever project in React and I was learning how React and Flux works on it.
